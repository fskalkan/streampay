# Contributing to StreamPay

Thanks for helping build streaming payments for Stellar! This doc covers the
conventions, the branch/PR process, and how to run everything locally.

## Project layout

```text
contracts/streaming-payments/   the Soroban contract (Rust, no_std)
frontend/                       minimal Next.js + Freighter UI
docs/                           ARCHITECTURE.md, GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md
.github/workflows/ci.yml        CI: test + fmt + clippy + frontend build
```

## Setup (clean machine)

1. Install Rust ≥ 1.84 (<https://rustup.rs>) and add the wasm target:
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32v1-none
   ```
2. Install the Stellar CLI (contract Wasm builds, deploys):
   ```bash
   cargo install stellar-cli --locked
   ```
3. Node.js ≥ 20 for the frontend (<https://nodejs.org>).

## Running the tests locally

```bash
# Contract: the full gate CI runs
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p streampay-contract

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

A PR is green when all six commands pass.

## Coding conventions

### Rust / contract

- **No panics on expected failures.** Every public entrypoint returns
  `Result<_, StreamError>`; every arithmetic op on user amounts is checked
  (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`, capacity pre-checks). If a computation can
  overflow, return `StreamError::MathOverflow` — don't wrap, don't panic.
- **Errors are append-only.** Add new `StreamError` variants at the bottom with
  the next free code; never renumber or reuse codes (they are part of the
  client-facing API).
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions.** All storage writes and event emissions
  happen before any token transfer. New entrypoints must preserve this — add a
  test that proves it if you add a new payout path.
- **Pure math stays pure.** Rate/accrual functions take no `Env`, so they are
  unit-testable and fuzzable without a Soroban host.
- **Events are the public ledger.** Every state change emits an event with
  `stream_id` as a topic. If you add an event, filter tests by contract and
  compare typed XDR, not strings.
- Storage: per-stream state under `DataKey::Stream(id)` with TTL extension on
  mutation (see `stream.rs`). No global registry vectors — indexers exist for
  that.
- `#![no_std]` — no allocations where an array or `soroban_sdk::Vec` works.
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing; CI enforces `--check`.

### TypeScript / frontend

- Strict TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit` must be clean); no `any` without a comment
  explaining why.
- Amounts from the contract are `bigint`/string in **smallest token units** —
  never `number` for math.
- All contract interaction lives in `frontend/lib/stellar.ts`; components stay
  presentational.
- Mutating flow is always: build → simulate → Freighter sign → send → poll →
  decode. Don't skip simulation; it's our error-message surface.

### Docs

- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when behavior changes — it's the source of
  truth for design decisions, including rejected alternatives.
- Error codes and events are documented in tables; keep the tables in sync.

## Branch & PR process

1. **Branch from `main`**, named `feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, or
   `docs/<topic>` (e.g. `feat/pause-stream`).
2. **Keep PRs small** — one feature or fix per PR. Contract changes should
   come with tests; behavior changes should update ARCHITECTURE.md.
3. **Commit style**: imperative subject line ≤ 72 chars
   (`withdraw: reject zero amounts early`), body explains *why*.
4. **PR checklist** (CI enforces, but save the round-trip):
   - [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
   - [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
   - [ ] `cargo test -p streampay-contract`
   - [ ] `cd frontend && npm run typecheck && npm run build` (if frontend touched)
   - [ ] Tests for new behavior; ARCHITECTURE.md updated for design changes
5. **Reviews**: one maintainer approval for docs/frontend, two for changes to
   `lib.rs`/`stream.rs` (money-touching code).
6. Squash-merge with a conventional subject; the squashed subject becomes the
   changelog entry.
