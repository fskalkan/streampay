//! Error types for StreamPay.
//!
//! Every expected failure is expressed as a [`StreamError`] variant with a
//! stable numeric code, so clients can branch on failures without parsing
//! strings. The contract never panics on expected failure paths: all public
//! entrypoints return `Result<_, StreamError>` and all arithmetic is checked.
//!
//! Codes are part of the public interface — never renumber or reuse a variant;
//! only append new ones.
