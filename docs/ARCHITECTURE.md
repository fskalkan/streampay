# StreamPay architecture

How StreamPay works internally: the storage model, the accrual math, auth and
reentrancy, TTL strategy, and the design decisions behind the v1 API. Read the
[README](../README.md) first for the overview.

## 2. Storage model

| Key | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DataKey::NextStreamId` | `u64` | monotonic id counter (ids start at 1) |
| `DataKey::Stream(id)` | `Stream` | full per-stream state |

Streams live in **persistent** storage. Every mutating entrypoint that touches
a stream extends its TTL (`TTL_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS = 200_000`, extend to
`500_000` ≈ 29 days), so a stream that is being used never goes cold, while
abandoned streams naturally archive to off-chain recovery — the Soroban-native
way to bound state bloat without penalizing active users.

There is deliberately **no iterable registry** of all streams (no
`Vec<u64>` of ids): it would make `create_stream` gas cost grow with total
stream count. Indexers recover the id list from `StreamCreated` events; a
paginated `list_streams` is a roadmap item, not a v1 feature.

## 3. Accrual math

Everything reduces to one pure function (`stream.rs`):

```rust
streamed_at(deposit: i128, duration: u64, elapsed: u64) -> Result<i128, StreamError>
```

- `elapsed == 0` (before `start_time`) → `0`
- `elapsed >= duration` (at/after `end_time`) → `deposit`
- otherwise → `deposit * elapsed / duration`, floored

Safety properties:

1. **Capacity pre-check at creation/top-up.** `validate_capacity` requires
   `deposit ≤ u128::MAX / duration`, so the worst-case product can never
   overflow *later* — turning per-call overflow handling into a one-time
   admission check.
2. **Widened products.** The product is computed in `u128`; a result is capped
   at `deposit` before narrowing back to `i128` (safe: `deposit ≤ i128::MAX`
   was checked on admission).
3. **Checked everywhere.** All `+`/`-` on user-relevant amounts use
   `checked_add` / `checked_sub` and map failure to
   `StreamError::MathOverflow`. No arithmetic operator in the contract can
   panic.
4. **Rounding never benefits the sender.** Floor division means a partial
   second is *never* counted as streamed; over the full window
   `streamed(duration) = deposit` exactly, so the recipient is always made
   whole by the end. The floor dust accumulates to the recipient, not the
   sender — verified by the property test (partial withdrawals ≤ full-window
   accrual).

The window is **half-open** `[start_time, end_time)`: at `now == start_time`
nothing has accrued, at `now ≥ end_time` the full duration has elapsed.

## 4. Auth model

| Action | who may call | auth consumed |
|---|---|---|
| `create_stream` | anyone; `sender` must authorize | sender |
| `withdraw` | recipient only | recipient |
| `cancel_stream` | sender always; recipient iff `cancelable` | caller |
| `top_up` | sender only | sender |

The `cancelable` flag is chosen per stream at creation: payroll senders often
want sender-only cancellation, while vesting recipients may want the right to
walk away with what they've earned.

`require_auth()` is called *before* any state reads that depend on the caller's
identity, and errors use `StreamError` codes rather than SDK auth panics where
the condition is a business rule (e.g. `NotAuthorized` for a stranger calling
`cancel_stream`).

## 5. Reentrancy: checks-effects-interactions

Every entrypoint follows CEI ordering — all storage writes and event emissions
happen **before** the token transfers:

- `withdraw`: mark `withdrawn += amount`, set `Depleted` if fully drained,
  emit `Withdrawn`, *then* `token.transfer`.
- `cancel_stream`: set `Cancelled`, record the payout as withdrawn, emit
  `StreamCancelled`, *then* the two transfers.
- `create_stream` / `top_up`: pull tokens first, persist after — if a
  reentrant callback abused the transfer-in, the persisted state still
  reconciles with the balance (invariant below).

Additionally, `withdraw` and `cancel_stream` re-read `status` after auth: a
malicious token contract that reenters `withdraw` during its own transfer
callback finds `withdrawn` already updated, and `available_amount` reverts to
the *post-write* (smaller or zero) value. The suite contains a
malicious-token test that attempts exactly this reentry.

**Balance invariant:** the contract's token balance is always
`≥ Σ (deposit − withdrawn)` across live streams. Funds enter only via
`create_stream`/`top_up` and leave only via `withdraw`/`cancel_stream`, and
every exit is bounded by the invariant `0 ≤ withdrawn ≤ streamed ≤ deposit`.

## 6. Lifecycle states

```text
            create_stream
                 │
                 ▼
              Active ──── cancel_stream ────▶ Cancelled (terminal)
                 │        (pro-rata split:
                 │         recipient ← available,
                 │         sender ← deposit − streamed)
                 │
                 ├─ withdrawn == deposit ──▶ Depleted (terminal)
                 │
                 └─ top_up allowed while Active (even after end_time:
                    funds become fully accrued → recipient withdraws)
```

- Cancelling a `Depleted` stream reverts (`StreamNotActive`) — there is
  nothing left to split.
- Cancelling a not-yet-started stream is a 100 % refund to the sender.
- `top_up` on a cancelled/depleted stream reverts.

## 7. Error surface

`StreamError` variants carry explicit numeric codes (`contracterror`), part of
the public interface:

| Code | Variant | Raised when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `StreamNotFound` | no stream with this id |
| 2–3 | `NotStreamSender` / `NotStreamRecipient` | reserved role checks |
| 4 | `StreamNotCancellable` | recipient cancels a non-cancelable stream |
| 5 | `StreamNotActive` | cancelled/depleted stream mutated |
| 6 | `StartTimeInPast` | `start_time` before current ledger timestamp |
| 7 | `InvalidTimeRange` | `end_time ≤ start_time` (zero duration) |
| 8 | `DurationTooLong` | window exceeds `MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` (100 y) |
| 9 | `ZeroAmount` | deposit / withdrawal / top-up `≤ 0` |
| 10 | `AmountExceedsAvailable` | withdrawal above accrued balance |
| 11 | `MathOverflow` | a checked computation would overflow |
| 12 | `NotAuthorized` | caller is neither sender nor (cancelable) recipient |

Codes are **append-only**: never renumber or reuse a variant.

## 8. Design decisions (and rejected alternatives)

**Wall-clock accrual (`timestamp`), not per-ledger counters.** Streams are
expressed in seconds so a stream behaves identically on testnet, mainnet, and
in tests. On mainnet ledgers are ~5 s, so granularity is bounded by the
ledger cadence; the floor division in `streamed_at` makes under-granular
ledger boundaries always conservative.

**Sender pulls via `transfer_from` (approval), not first-class
`TokenInterface::approve`+escrow flows.** One approval + one create tx; the
contract is the escrow. This matches SAC semantics (`transfer_from` consumes a
real allowance) and keeps `create_stream` atomic.

**Top-up does not extend `end_time`.** Extending would re-baseline accrual and
can retroactively *reduce* the recipient's available balance (the extra funds
spread over a longer window). v1 keeps top-up strictly additive — accrued
amounts only grow. If demand exists, a `create_stream` from the remainder of a
fully-streamed stream is the clean composition (roadmap).

**No stream registry vector.** See §2 — event-sourced discovery instead.

**Terminal states are terminal.** No reactivation, no partial cancellation.
Simplicity is a security feature; richer flows belong in composing contracts
or off-chain UX.

## 9. Testing strategy

- **Unit tests** (`test.rs`) cover every spec edge case: withdraw before
  start / at / after end, sequential partial withdrawals, cancel before start
  / fully-withdrawn / not-cancelable, top-up after end, zero-duration and
  zero-amount rejection, `i128::MAX`-scale checked math, event emission
  (typed, per-contract-filtered), and a malicious-token reentrancy attempt.
- **Property test**: random `(deposit, duration)` — for random sample points
  `t ≤ duration`, the sum of payouts up to `t` never exceeds
  `streamed_at(deposit, duration, t)`, and `streamed_at(..., duration) ==
  deposit` exactly.
- **Rate math is pure** (`streamed_at` takes no `Env`), so a `cargo-fuzz`
  target can hammer it without a Soroban host (roadmap issue).

## 10. Open problems / roadmap hooks

- `pause_stream` (sender-initiated temporary hold) — needs a fourth status and
  careful `cancel_amounts` treatment; drafted as a good-first-issue.
- Multi-token batch creation — one tx, N streams; watch the instruction
  budget, likely `try_create_batch` with per-item results.
- Gas optimization pass on storage reads — `cancel_stream` does one
  read-modify-write; a `Stream` split into hot/cold fields could shave bytes.
- Event indexer service — TypeScript worker polling `getEvents` per topic
  `stream_id`, materializing stream history for the UI.
